We recommend meeting once a week.

You can recruit outside speakers to give short presentations related to your
group's focus topic and also encourage members themselves to present something
new they've learned or share projects they are working on. Try to vary the level
of talks from beginner to more intermediate or advanced. Keep the presentation
short and informal however so the focus of the group is on self-paced study
time.

During study time, encourage members to speak up and help each other if they get
stuck. Allow members to study as they wish using the materials of their choice
or to work on personal projects. Members can either study independently or join
the small groups to work together as they prefer.
